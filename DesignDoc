Design Document:
	-Description for Underlying Data Structures for Interfaces:
		-MyPriorirtyQueue uses array in order to simulate a binary heap. This meets the Big-O requirements for all methods by simulating a complete binary tree
		using the array, hitting the logN requirements by incrementing the i value in the for loops by either "i * 2" or "i * 2 + 1" for insert and remove.
		
		-MySymbolTable uses a HashMap in order to keep track of all the symbols and records being stored. HashMap was imported, as per the design specs, and meets all Big-O requirements
		with very little modification.
		
		-MySequence uses a TreeSet in order to make the collection. TreeSet is imported, as per the design specs, and meets all logN requirements by its very nature. CountNoSmallerThan uses 
		the TreeSet method tailSet in order to find all values greater than or equal to the specified one. This value is then returned in my method. 
	-Code Reference:
		-TreeSet was imported from the java.util library, HashMap was also imported from this same library.
